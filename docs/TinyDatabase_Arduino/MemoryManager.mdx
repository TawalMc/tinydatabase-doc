> MemoryManager is the main class used to access data base. You need
an object of this class to work on tables.

## TinyDatabase header

Be sure that the library header was included in your sketch 

```cpp title="header"
#include <TinyDatabase_Arduino.h>
```

## Work on tables

### Constructor

```cpp title="constructor"
MemoryManager()
```

To create an object

```cpp title="example"
MemoryManager mem;
```

### Erase all

If it is a new project, be sure to clear all the EEPROM with

```cpp title="prototype"
void clearAll()
```

```cpp	title="exemple"
mem.clearAll();
```


### Table creation

You can create easily a table by invoking `CREATE_TABLE` methods

```cpp title="prototype"
int CREATE_TABLE(char* tableName, 
				uint8_t capacity, 
				uint8_t col,
                Column tableCol[])
```

1. `tableName`:	the name of your table - no more than 2 char

2. `capacity`:	the maximum of data that the table can hold. If this
value is attended the next data start override old data from the top

3. `col`:	the number of columns for this table

4. `tableCol`:	an array of columns structre. Its contain all table's
columns with their name and type. Go to [Column](Column) to know
more.

- `return` a status code. The creation can be aborted if capacity value
exceeds **255** or memory is not available or something else.
[Check status code](../STATUS_CODE) to know more.


```cpp title="example"
Column allCols[] = {{"ag", "INT"}, {"rt", "FLOAT"}}; 
mem.CREATE_TABLE("EM", 15, 2, allCols);
```
- We create firstly two columns named `ag` and `rt` of types `INT` and `FLOAT`. Read more
about [TinyDatabase types](../Types) 
- Then the table with name `EM` of `15` as its capacity. 

:::danger
Tables name and columns name cannot be more than 02 characters. Othwersie 
we cut off and take only the first two char. They follow variables name
structure.
:::

:::tip
- For table name you can use uppercase letters like **EM** or **PT** or underscore
as last char like **E_** or **P_**.
- And use lowercase letter for columns name like **ag** or **hm**.
:::

### Display meta data

You can print in Serial monitor informations about the data base: meta data.
It contains amount of data, tables informations, address where these informations
are stored

```cpp title="prototype"
void printMetaData()
```

```cpp title="example"
mem.printMetaData(); // open your serial monitor
```

### Table existence

You can check if a table exists in the database if you know its name.

```cpp title="prototype"
int ON(char* tableName)
```

1. `tableName`: the name of the table you want to check

- `return` a negative number (status code) if the table doesn't exist and 
a positive number if it exists (the address where this tables meta data are stored). 

### Set data

There are two mains actions that can be done on a table: write or read.
If you want to write or delete data on table:

```cpp title="prototype"
TableData& TO(char* tableName)
```

1. `tableName`: the name of table on what you want to work.

- `return` a reference to private member of **MemoryManager** to allow you 
to chain methods after when setting data on this table. If table doesn't exist, it
return an invalid object of **TableData**.

```cpp title="example"
TableData t_data = mem.TO("EM");
```

### Get data

In the cas where you want to get data from the table:

```cpp title="prototype"
TableData& FROM(char* tableName)
```

1. `tableName`: the name of table on what you want to work.

- `return` a reference to private member of **MemoryManager** to allow you 
to chain methods after when getting data from this table. If table doesn't exist, it
returns an invalid object of **TableData**.

```cpp title="example"
TableData t_data = mem.FROM("EM");
```

:::tip
- `TO` and `FROM` methods do the samething and has the same structure but it is
more readable if you:
- **TO** for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DELETE_ALL` queries;
- **FROM** for `SELECT`,`SELECT_ALL`, queries.
:::

## Useful methods

### Memory availability

You can check if there is more memory available in the data base.

```cpp title="prototype"
int isMemoryAvailable(int need)
```

1. `need`: the amount of space. 

- `return` a status code. [Check status code](../STATUS_CODE) to know more.

```cpp title="example"
int memAvailableStatus =  mem.isMemoryAvailable(100); // open your serial monitor
```

### Data size

You can check the possible amount data stored in the database (sum of all 
capacity).

```cpp title="prototype"
int size()
```

```cpp title="example"
int amount = mem.size();
```

### Amount of tables

You can also check the number of tables 

```cpp title="prototype"
uint8_t nbTables()
```

:::caution
You cannot create more than **255** tables in the database.
